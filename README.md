### About Me üöÄ  
My passion lies both in **AI** and **Game Development**, and I strive to find ways for these two worlds to meet. I have worked professionally as an **AI Solutions Engineer**, where I was required to be flexible, adaptive, and resourceful in addressing unique use-cases. I've worked with up-and-coming services released by **Microsoft** and am always up-to-date with **AI Cloud Services** to enable cost-effective, robust solutions for enterprises.

In my free time, my creativity is explored through **Game Development**, where I've developed a non-Euclidean game inspired by **Portal 2** for my Final Year Project. My ultimate goal is to revolutionize the gaming market in **Pakistan**, and this is just a part of my long journey.
